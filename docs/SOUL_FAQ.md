- #### What is SOUL?

    You might want to read the [project overview](./SOUL_Overview.md).

- #### Who created SOUL?

    SOUL was first dreamt-up by Julian Storer at ROLI/JUCE in 2016, and announced publicly at [ADC2018](https://youtu.be/-GhleKNaPdk?t=910). Its initial beta release was in November 2019.

- #### What is the project status?

    SOUL is in a public beta, under active development. It's a long-term multi-year project that spans a huge range of target devices, tools and use-cases.

    Areas that we're actively working on include the core compiler, the web playground, the JIT engine, cross-language code generators, and we're working with partners to get built-in SOUL for audio hardware and DAWs.

- #### How can I write some SOUL code?

    The easiest way is to try the web playground at [soul.dev](https://soul.dev/lab)
    You can also load and live-code SOUL patches using the latest versions of [Tracktion Waveform](https://tracktion.com/products/waveform)
    You can also compile and play patches using the [command-line tools](https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/releases/latest)

- #### Where can I find more technical details?

    The project website is at [soul.dev](https://soul.dev).
    This repository has various other guides in the [docs](../docs/) folder.
    You can look at some of the [source code](../source) in this repository

- #### Where can I give feedback, get help, or discuss the project?

    Until we set up a dedicated forum, the best public forum for discussing SOUL is probably the [JUCE forum](https://forum.juce.com/), where the team are available to answer questions.

- #### What is the licensing/business model?

    Our intention is to make SOUL entirely free and unencumbered for developers to use.
    All our public source code is [permissively (ISC) licensed](../LICENSE.md). We're currently keeping some of our secret sauce closed-source, but the [EULA](../SOUL-EULA.md) allows use of it freely to encourage its adoption in 3rd party hardware and software.
    Ultimately, we plan to commercialise SOUL by licensing back-end drivers and other IP for use by vendors who are building SOUL-compatible hardware products.
